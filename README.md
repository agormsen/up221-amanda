## :nerd_face: Personal Profile:
Amanda G. is a second year Master of Urban and Regional Planning and Latin American Studies dual degree student at UCLA. Prior to UCLA, she completed her undergraduate degree at William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA with a double major in Environmental Policy and Finance. Professionally, Amanda worked for 3 years in federal consulting on workforce and technology projects at the Department of Treasury, Department of Agriculture, and Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C. Academically, Amanda is interested in climate change mitigation and adaptation, environmental justice, and urban planning in Latin America. Amanda grew up in Northern Virginia and lived in Washington, D.C. before moving west to Los Angeles. She spent this past summer living, working, and eating her way through Querétaro, México!

## :notebook: Course Description:
The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

## :world_map: Project Ideas:
I am interested in exploring projects related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, environmental justice, and urban planning in Latin America. I would like to potentially use data related to extreme heat events, green gentrification, and public transportation in Los Angeles.

## :pencil2: Course Objectives:
At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

Specifically, students will learn to:
- Demonstrate the value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
- Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
- Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
- Learn to visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
- Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps

*I am looking forward to taking my first course related to coding, mapping, and spatial data analysis. I aim to develop beginner to intermediate level Python/GIS skills and greater familiarity and comfortability with this subject matter. Lastly, I hope to be able to utilize and grow these skills in a professional setting.*
