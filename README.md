## :nerd_face: Personal Profile:
Amanda G. is a second year Master of Urban and Regional Planning and Latin American Studies dual degree student at UCLA. Prior to UCLA, she completed her undergraduate degree at William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA with a double major in Environmental Policy and Finance. Professionally, Amanda worked for 3 years in federal consulting on workforce and technology projects at the Department of Treasury, Department of Agriculture, and Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C. Academically, Amanda is interested in climate change mitigation and adaptation, environmental justice, and urban planning in Latin America. Amanda grew up in Northern Virginia and lived in Washington, D.C. before moving west to Los Angeles. She spent this past summer living, working, and eating her way through Querétaro, México!

## :notebook: Course Description:
Welcome to the world of planning and spatial thinking. In recent years, our relationship with maps and map-making has changed dramatically. No longer are we limited to a mode of map-making that is dominated by industry giants like Google and ESRI. Instead, a suite of data-science tools have matured to a point where they can produce similar, if not, more powerful and creative ways that advance spatial exploration.

Our understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways. This course prepares you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective.

The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on “real” data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

In addition to the programming lab sessions, you will be given weekly or bi-weekly "thinking cap" assignments, where you will be asked to think critically about contemporary urban issues. Be prepared to address various topics from the perspective of your own lived experiences, how it informs the topic, and what kind of research can advance knowledge in a positive way.

While there are no prerequisites for taking this course, people who are approaching programming for the first time will admittedly find the course to be intense and challenging.

## :world_map: Project Ideas:
I am interested in exploring projects related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, environmental justice, and urban planning in Latin America. I would like to potentially use data related to extreme heat events, green gentrification, and public transportation in Los Angeles.

## :pencil2: Course Objectives:
At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

Specifically, students will learn to:
- Demonstrate the value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
- Critically evaluate data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
- Apply data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
- Learn to visualize data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
- Learn to produce publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps
